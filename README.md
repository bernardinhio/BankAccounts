The idea of this project is to show the beauty of Kotlin programming language compared to Java and show some special features, operators and techniques that are very powerful in Kotlin. I have been doing Kotlin in my Android apps since January 2018 and I really enjoy this beautiful language.

For a basic Banking system, there are in general 2 types of accounts: CheckingAccount and SavingAccount. Clients can say they want to “freeze” some amount of money in their SavingAccount where they can benefit from an interest rate or they can use their CheckingAcount for daily usage and sometimes they can withdraw more (overdraft limit) than what they actually have depending on factors determined by the bank.

In brief, I used in this project many types of Classes and elements (properties & methods) in Kotlin such as Abstract classes, enu class, Static class…

The App will simulate different methods of the protocols of classes such as adding / withdrawing cash or transfers.

Many methods are created such as checking different balances of total money or SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount.

Also methods the back can do such as setting the yearly interest rate for all SavaingAccounts

The App should simulate:
Transfers between 2 CheckingAccounts online
Transfers between 2 CheckingAccounts at the back
Withdrawing or adding money with the cash machine
Withdrawing or adding money at the back
Reserving money from the same user CheckingAccount to his SabingsAccount
Checking Total balance
Checking CheckingAccount balance
Checking SavingsAccount balance
Taking money more than client actually has up to the maximum limit (overdraft limit)
Calculating the interest of the current SavingAccount balance per month
